# Hewitt_Foundation_Project

## THE HEWITT LEARNING FOUNDATION
* to equip families to educate their own children using the best resources available
* Based in Spokane since 1963
* Resources + standardized testing (PASS Test)
* 2,435 Students Enrolled, 132,618 PASS Tests taken
* For more information: https://hewittlearning.org/

## More about P.A.S.S. Test
* PASS Stands for Personalized Achievement Summary System
* The PASS test is like other standardized test but made especially for homeschoolers and can be administered from home.
* The test assess students in three different subjects (reading, language arts and math).
* Test provides 1-25 different test levels. It allow students to pick the test levels which they think would be appropriate for them.
* Hewitt gives percentile of how a student did compared to other homeschoolers who took the same test, and on top of that, they’ll  give a percentile of how a student did compared to a national standardized test.
* Hewitt converts both the percentiles in a measure known as RIT score which would make it easier to assess each student.

## Task
* Determine how much student performance has changed on the PASS test since the design in 1988 and, consequently, if the test should be re-normed
* Importance: determining if it is worth the resources required to renormalize
* Less modeling, more trends 
* Point person: Martha Gady (Head of the Department, Mathematics and Computer Science, Whitworth University) – Board Member

## Data
* Subjects Math, Language, Reading
* Math Test >30 vs <30
* Grades 3-9 (grade 9 can be disregarded)
* RIT (Rasch UnIT) – measure of student’s knowledge (main Predictor for
performance)
* Non personalized 
* Previously Cleaned
* Challenge - large quantity, shallow
